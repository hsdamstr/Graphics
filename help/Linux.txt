=== Linux installation instructions ===

For the general idea of how to install this software, review the top
of README.txt first.

If you are not on a Michigan Tech administered Linux lab computer, you
will need to install the libraries. To install them on Ubuntu
20.04, try:

apt install cmake make build-essential imagemagick libmagickwand-dev assimp-utils libassimp-dev libglfw3-dev glew-utils libglew-dev xorg-dev

The above command assumes that you are using X instead of Wayland for
graphics. Some of the packages have version numbers in them.
Therefore, different versions of Ubuntu might have slightly different
package names. To find the right package name, use "apt search assimp"
to search for available packages that have "assimp" in them. For
alternative ways to install these packages, look at the files in this
folder for each of the individual libraries.

Once the libraries are installed, go into the opengl-examples folder and run:

cmake .

If there are error messages, then need to work to resolve them. If you
don't have assimp installed, you will get a warning message and some
of the programs will not compile (but some will).

If cmake was successful, run the following to compile the programs:

make


To run a program, try:

cd bin
./triangle


If you encounter strange issues with cmake, try running:

./cleanup.sh
cmake .
make
cd bin
./triangle

(The cleanup.sh script will delete any extra cache files that cmake
creates/uses).
