Reminder: VRPN is only necessary if you are going to connect to 
a VRPN tracking system.

=== Linux installation ===

VRPN is often missing from popular Linux package managers. 

To install, follow these steps:

wget 'https://github.com/vrpn/vrpn/releases/download/v07.33/vrpn_07_33.zip'
unzip vrpn_07_33.zip
cd vrpn
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DVRPN_GPL_SERVER=1 ..
make

OPTIONAL: If you have root access to the machine and want to install
the library and include files into /usr/local so that cmake can easily
find them, run:

cd vrpn/build
sudo make install

If you do NOT follow the optional step above, you must modify
CMakeLists.txt to tell it where your copy of VRPN is.

A NOTE ABOUT IVS:

The exiting CMakeLists.txt should find VRPN on IVS. If VRPN ever needs
to be recompiled on IVS, we found that this command works:

cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/g++ -DVRPN_BUILD_PYTHON= -DVRPN_BUILD_PYTHON_HANDCODED_2X= .


=== macOS installation ===

VRPN is available in homebrew.


=== Windows installation ===

Download the latest VRPN release from github (see link in the Linux instructions above). Extract
the file inside of a "opengl-libs" folder that is next to your "opengl-examples" folder.

Then, run cmake-gui with C:\...\opengl-libs\vrpn as the source code folder and 
C:\...\opengl-libs\vrpn\build as the place to build the binaries.

Then, configure, generate, open the solution in Visual Studio. Build the "Libraries" target.
This will create vrpnd.lib and quatd.lib files somewhere in your vrpn\build directories. 
The 'd' at the end of the name denotes that these are "Debug" libraries.

Then, open cmake-gui for the opengl-examples project. Go to "File | Delete cache", then click
the "Configure" button. Confirm that VRPN is found. Click "Generate". Finally, open the project
in Visual Studio (and, if prompted, reload the project due to the changed files). Confirm that
the triangle program builds and runs successfully.
