You can find ASSIMP at: https://github.com/assimp/assimp/releases

--- SELECTING AN ASSIMP VERSION ---

Any recent version of assimp should work. Versions as old as 4.1.0
should work on Linux, Mac, and Windows.
   

--- LINUX INSTRUCTIONS ---

First try installing ASSIMP via your distributions package manager. On
many systems, you will need to install both the library and the
associated headers (for example libassimp3 and libassimp-dev).

If you decide to compile it yourself:
Download it from the website listed above
Extract files
cmake .
make

If you encounter problems compiling assimp 3.2, try changing "cmake ."
to "cmake -DASSIMP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF ."

Next, use one of the following two options:
 1) Run "sudo make install" to install ASSIMP into /usr/local
 2) Edit opengl-examples/CMakeLists.txt and find where it adds paths to search for assimp. 
    Add an appropriate path to the list.


--- macOS INSTRUCTIONS ---

Install homebrew and run "brew install assimp"


--- WINDOWS INSTRUCTIONS ---

Download ASSIMP source code. Ensure that you have CMake and Visual Studio installed.
Don't use cmake built into Visual Studio; I've had trouble with it.

Run cmake-gui

Set the root directory of the ASSIMP source code to be 
"where is the source code:" and "where to build the binaries:".

Click "Configure". Select Visual Studio and native compilers. 
Any red warning messages about Qt being missing can be ignored.

Click "Generate".

"Open Project" with Visual Studio.

Right click on the "assimp" solution and select "Build". If you try to
build the ALL_BUILD solution and didn't set ASSIMP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF in 
cmake, then ALL_BUILD may not work correctly.

Refer back to WINDOWS-VisualStudio.txt to get opengl-examples to work with your library.

We can delete the following folders to save ~800MB space after compilation:
assimp-???/.vs
assimp-???/code/assimp.dir
assimp-???/test
However, you may need to start from scratch a fresh assimp folder 
if you need to recompile later.
