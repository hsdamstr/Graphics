This software works with ImageMagick 6 or 7 via the MagickWand
library. On Windows, only ImageMagick 7 is supported. ImageMagick
6 is officialy a 'legacy' version that will be supported for a long
time even though version 7 was released in 2016. Some linux 
distributions haven't switched their default version to
imagemagick 7 yet since the API changed.

== Ubuntu instructions ==

On Ubuntu, try installing the following two packages (and the
packages that they depend on):
imagemagick
libmagickwand-6.q16-dev

Do not install HDRI versions of ImageMagick. If you do, your program
may hang when reading images.

== macOS - Homebrew instructions ==

Install imagemagick with:
brew install imagemagick

THE FOLLOWING IS NO LONGER NEEDED:
We used to use ImageMagick to render fonts. If we 
enable this again, then we also need to ensure that ghostscript support is
enabled. Run the following command:

Verify that imagemagick has access to fonts by running:

convert -list font

If fonts are not available, then follow these instructions:

== Windows instructions ==

Download a version (7 or above) of ImageMagick at: imagemagick.org

There are many versions to choose from. Select the file ending in "-Q16-HDRI-x64-dll.exe"

Run the installation program and check the following checkbox:
"install development headers and libraries for C and C++"

Reopen opengl-examples in Visual Studio, and select "Project" and 
then "Delete Cache and Reconfigure". Cmake output should show
that it found ImageMagick. You can also run an opengl-examples program 
and then view the log.txt file that it creates. Near the top should 
be a list of libraries that it is compiled against. You should see 
ImageMagick in the list.	

	
== Compiling form source on Linux and OS X ==

If you need to compile ImageMagick yourself:

1) Download the ImageMagick source file and extract the files

2) cd into the ImageMagick directory.

3) Run "./configure"

4) If configure fails, it will probably complain about one or more
missing libraries. Install those libraries and try running configure
again.

5) Run "make"

6a) If you are administrator and want to install the library into
/usr/local/ on your system, run "sudo make install"

6b) If you aren't administrator and/or don't want to install the
library onto your system, open CMakeLists.txt. Look for where
CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH and CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH are set in the area of the
file that involves ImageMagick. You can add additional lines to tell
cmake where your copy of ImageMagick is installed.
